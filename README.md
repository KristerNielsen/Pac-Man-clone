Pac-Man-clone
=============

This is my first time using GitHub while I'm starting off learning about OOP C++ programming. The project is an attempt to replicate the original Pac-Man arcade game using Allegro.

The first commit is a semi-working version but with a set window size three times larger than the original. The idea is to later make it in its original size where you can scale the window or use full-screen.

One note is on the TTF-font I've created:

A-Z are used for the regular letters


a-q are used for miscellaneous specials like PTS, 100, 300, 500, 700 and 1000 point score


", !, -, / represent their respective characters


@ is used as the copyright symbol
